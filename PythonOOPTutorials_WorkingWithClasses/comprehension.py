# What’s a class?
# A class is a mechanism used to create new user-defined data structures.
# It contains data as well as the methods used to process that data.

# What’s an instance?
# An instance is a copy of the class with actual values, literally an object of a specific class.

# What’s the relationship between a class and an instance?
# While a class is a blueprint used to describe how to make something, instances are objects created from those blueprints.

# What’s the Python syntax used for defining a new class?
# class PythonClassName:

# What’s the spelling convention for a class name?
# CamelCase notation, starting with a capital letter - i.e., PythonClassName()

# How do you instantiate, or create an instance of, a class?
# You use the the class name, followed by parentheses.
# So if the class name is Dog(), an dog instance would be - my_class = Dog().

# How do you access the attributes and behaviors of a class instance?
# With dot notation - e.g., instance_name.attribute_name

# What’s a method?
# A function that’s defined inside a class.

# What’s the purpose of self?
# The first argument of every method references the current instance of the class,
# which by convention, is named self. In the __init__ method, self refers to the newly created object;
# while in other methods, self refers to the instance whose method was called. For more on __init__ vs. self,
# check out this article.

# What’s the purpose of the __init__ method?
#The __init__ method initializes an instance of a class.

# Describe how inheritance helps prevent code duplication.
#Child classes inherit all of the parent’s attributes and behaviors.

# Can child classes override properties of their parents?
#YES
